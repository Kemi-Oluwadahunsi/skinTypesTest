Title: SKIN TYPE TEST

Description: Built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. A fully responsive single webpage, user-friendly and easy to navigate. Clicking on each skin type displays the image, description, and care routine to follow for each of them. The simple nature color blend is the best part for me.

PAGE NAVIGATION: Since it's a single webpage, scrolling from top to bottom is all you need to navigate through the page. Click on each skintype blocks to view the full details of each, the details flex-direction on the laptop view is on row while on smaller screen sizes, it's on column.
