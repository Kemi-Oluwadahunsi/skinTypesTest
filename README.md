Title: SKIN TYPE TEST

Description: Built with pure HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. A fully responsive single webpage, user-friendly and easy to navigate. Clicking on each skin type displays the image, description, and care routine for each. The simple natural color blend is the best part for me.

The function of JavaScript in this code is to hide or display on toggle the details of each skin type. This was done so as not to make the page too crowded with words.

PAGE NAVIGATION: Since it's a single webpage, scrolling from top to bottom is all you need to navigate the page. Click on each skin type block to view the full details of each skin type. The flex-direction of the information on the laptop view is in a row while on smaller screen sizes, it's in a column.
